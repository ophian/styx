<br><b>NOTE:</b> "b46" is an upgrade Engine:Template of the "bootstrap4" theme.
<ul>
    <li>For custom theme styling of entries freetags, enable the "Extended Smarty" option in the event freetag plugin.</li>
    <li>If you leave the "#" for the URL of a navigation-link, a popover submenu can be created manually in the index.tpl main template file. Example inside.</li>
</ul>
<b>Featured Article Pro Tip:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new category with the name "feature".<br>Explain yourself in the description (for later) what it means, e.g. "A special category for temporary featured articles (b46)". Save the new category.</li>
    <li>Then install the plugin "Properties/Templates of categories (serendipity_event_categorytemplates)" Event Plugin and configure it with the default properties ( <em>No, timestamp DESC, No, Empty </em>). This, as well as the following step, is optional.</li>
    <li>Go back to the category list and call the newly created category "feature" for editing. You now have a new options section at the bottom called "'.sprintf(ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES_BY_PLUGIN, "Properties/Templates of categories").'". Activate the final option in it to exclude the category from entry lists and RSS feeds in the future. ( <em>You may notice in the further that a duplicate setting will be activated in the following at the entryform as well. But <u>this</u> plugin setting would additionally help with other lists/links like for the entrypaging plugin. Have your own experiments with it, if in need at all.</em> )</li>
    <li>Then create an entry that will be linked as a featured article here in these theme options in "'.B46_LEAD.'". Make sure to assign this entry only to the category "feature" and to check "Do not show in article overview" and (optionally) "Hide entry content in RSS feed" in the "Extended properties for entries" section of the entry form.</li>
    <li>Simply use the article preview to copy the link to the article (right-click the title with mouse and "Save link"). Insert the copied link where "#" lives as "url=#" in the following shortened example array: "<em>image=/uploads/features/fa_1.webp&height=350px&title=My first longer featured blog post with ID 1&text=Summary feature of my post contents.&url=#&link=Continue reading...</em>" (see a full functional demo example in the info text of option "'.B46_LEAD.'" down below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Et voila ! Your promoted "featured article" will now link to the featured article as a single full article. Otherwise, it will only be link-accessible via the archives/category link in the blog. If at some point this article is back demoted for another/new one as a normal article, you have to only change the category in the article itself and uncheck the two checkboxes in the "Extended properties for entries" (as described above). As you can see, you now are able to enable a different way of dealing with "sticky articles" with this theme option, which are otherwise of course part of Serendipity\'s standard repertoire in the "Advanced article properties".</p>
