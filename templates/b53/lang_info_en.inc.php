$info['theme_info_summary'] = 'A "Bootstrap 5.3+" CSS HTML5 Framework theme by Ian Styx. Based on the Styx (bootstrap series 5) "boot" pool theme engine.';

$info['theme_info_desc'] = 'This is a basic interpretation for the new Bootstrap 5.3, including the dark/light or auto mode implementation handler.
Bootstrap 5.3 is a huge improvement for the Series 5.
The color handling frameset regarding native vs variable color modes, in special for the new dark/light mode implementation, actually is not finally
finished yet and will probably last until v.6 arrives, since Bootstrap colors are limited by backwards compatibility in changing key components like
buttons and more. It also is limited by color manipulation in vanilla CSS vs Sass.<br>
For early state, this "b53" theme is currently implemented standalone regarding the v.5.3 bootstrap assets and uses the bootstrap popper bundle.
Serendipity Styx will hand over these assets in general to the templates b5/ assets dir, when time has come and all other b5 themes were found working.';
