$info['theme_info_desc'] = 'This is a basic interpretation for Bootstrap 5.3, including new bootstrap dark/light mode handler.
Bootstrap 5.3 is a huge improvement for the Series 5 and currently is delivered as an alpha2 state, which is near to its final.
This color handling actually is not finally finished yet and will probably last until v6 arrives. Bootstrap currently is limited
by backwards compatibility in changing key components like buttons and more. It is also limited by color manipulation in vanilla
CSS vs Sass.';
