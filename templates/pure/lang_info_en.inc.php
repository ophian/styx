$info['theme_info_desc'] = 'This theme defines the current standard frontend up from Styx 3.0, defined and used by the core system.
Regarding Serendipity Styx infinite possibilities, it is one of the best-concatenated and interlocked themes,
covering most of them as simple as possible in a wide frame, made easy to look through.<br>
It is a "Holy Grail" of modern theme HTML5 structures. Fully responsive, with incremental font sizing <u>and</u> mobile friendly!<br>
<br>
<u><b>Theme building</b></u><br>
Copy an existing theme or add a new and unique directory name to the "templates/" directory, eg. "glory".
Add an <b>info.txt</b> file with the components of Pure (2020) to start with. Change the name, eg. to "Johns Glory" and add the current date as "yyyy-mm-dd".<br>
Give it an "Engine&colon; Pure" line if you want it to fall back to Pure, ie. for a custom CSS only theme.
If not having this line, you either need all template files for yourself, or regard your theme to fall back to the "Serendipity default" theme templates.<br>
<br>
Set additional lines "Require Serendipity&colon; 3.0", "Backend&colon; Yes",
if having an extra backend and "Responsive&colon; Yes" and "Mobile&colon; Yes", when it covers todays standard of responsive and mobile Web design.<br>
<br>
Back in your template list, reload the list page and select the new created theme.';
