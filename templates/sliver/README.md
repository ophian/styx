## Name: Sliver 2011

Silver slivered left/right, up to 4 Sidebars responsive **Coding-Theme** for the Serendipity Styx Blog system

Date: 2012-04-28

Original based on theme [Bulletproof] (https://github.com/ophian/styx) and a rock-solid default for HTML5 awesome [Boilerplate-3] (http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Author: Ian Styx

## Requirement:

Serendipity Styx: 2.2.0 and up

## Why:

* Developing very slowly, but already usable, HTML5 will become the new standard of the good old HTML and XHTML web.
* All modern browsers support it more or less. With boilerplates help, we already can use it in the wild.
* Its most outstanding feature allows every document element in HTML5 to have a corresponding JavaScript API, that describes how that element should behave in response to user actions and other events. Its up to you how to use them in this template.

## About:

* Sidebars left, Sidebars right, no Sidebars via templates config.
* Additional middle, top, footer Sidebars via admin panel plugin section.
* Use HTML5 semantic as general structure wrappers, be ready for new media elements, offering rich, interactive experience, and uses CSS3 features.

## Setup:

Sliver uses HTML5 and CSS3 features and ships with some external libs.

* **Config:** Sliver has multiple options to configure your template, as using Google CDN webfonts, local jQuery and corresponding libs, Google Analytics etc.

## Structure:

Sliver comes with nearly full boilerplate supported template root files, as there are

    .htaccess
	404.html (unused)

All Boilerplate and Sliver included files (like js, css) are found in these dirs.

    js/*
	css/*

## Attention:

* This template is not supposed to use any header images.
* The `.htaccess` file has an activated mod_rewrite option to turn `www.example.com` into `example.com`.

## Tweaking:

* **Archive:** The Archives page supports an additional staticpage file text & link for further or internal archive listings. Please customize and enable them in lang files and in your archive staticpage.
* **Fonts:** If you need to set some (Google) webfonts, please enable them in your sliver backend config.
* **Customize:** It is supposed to include your own JavaScript/CSS additions into `js/main.js` and in a update independent `user.css`.

## Errors:

If you experience curious problems in conjunction with Serendipity .htaccess settings, have a look in Slivers .htaccess file too.

## Endorsement:

This Template still is a Work In Progress / WIP.
