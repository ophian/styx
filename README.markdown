# Serendipity Styx - A reliable, secure & extensible PHP blog

[Serendipity Styx](https://ophian.github.io/) is a PHP-powered weblog engine which gives the user an easy way to maintain a Blog. While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers an expandable framework with the power for professional applications.

### Why Styx?
Its project name originally originates from *"River Styx"* in Greek classical mythology. Make your mind why this was chosen.
If this is too dark for you, you may read this as **S**erendipi**ty** Ne**x**t. :) or just **Sty x**.

By the time the real Maintainer began to silently retreat, *Serendipity 2.1-Alpha ++* more and more became a broken playground, simplifying things without need and commits without care and appreciation about its deepest nuances. Which I regret deeply.

**Styx** is what **Serendipity** should be!

After many years of heavy core, in special for the 1.7, 2.0 and 2.1 Series, and plugin development and long years of continuously help in the community, I came to the conclusion to stop my contributes for a while - "finish" the draft of the [2.1 HTML book][1] - present it as a birthday and farewell present to the *Serendipians* - in Spring 2016 - saw where the next S9y-Camp headed to - and realized that my expertise and insight wasn't really wanted any more. Some long month later I decided to go. Now - *21st of September* - it is done. **Alea iacta est!**

### The Serendipity Styx Edition

It was built in my origin intent primarily for myself to keep track on my vision of what Serendipity used to be, wide and open, and with multi levels of extended properties. I wanted it to not cut off this extendibility without real need. It is a contributed document of my deep affinity with Serendipity.

Serendipity Styx has strongly developed and has seen various releases since then. Previously one could say to just drop Styx over an old S9y Origin to run the internal upgrades without fear. But that was years ago and up with Serendipity Styx 3.0 in May 2020, easy migrations started to become a little bit more difficult. Go and read the <strong>Get Styx</strong> [‘install’ or ‘upgrade’](https://ophian.github.io/hc/en/installation.html#user-content-the-important-upgraders-howto---step-by-step-guide) guide to see how this can be easily done without too much effort. Even more you may want to read the [commit history](https://github.com/ophian/styx/commits/master) and/or the <strong>Styx</strong> [ChangeLog](https://github.com/ophian/styx/blob/master/docs/NEWS).

Since **plugins** are an essential part of Serendipity, this repository holds a strongly maintained additional_plugins repository. The Styx Spartacus Edition is able to work with it - Serendipity s9y origin is not. Please visit my [Blog](https://ophian.github.io/blog/) here to get all the information you need. The official Styx information and Blog site is presented here: [Styx home site](https://ophian.github.io/).

This new site for **Serendipity Styx** includes the [Serendipity Buch](https://ophian.github.io/book/), in a brand new 2022 revision!
